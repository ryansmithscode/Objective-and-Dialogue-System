# Objective and Dialogue System (2022)

Within this project I was the only programmer, amongst 6 other developers. There were three 3D Modelers, an artist and project manager. My role was to create the project’s third person controller, objective and dialogue system as the gameplay was a narrative walking simulator.

Unexpectedly due to the size of the team and inner conflict the final outcome was unstable but the scripts made can easily be adapted into other projects. Production took about 2 months and was developed using Unity's New Input System within Editor version 2021.3.14f1.
